1. `let area x = 3.14 * x * x`

The error was the extraneous space after the decimal. As well, the parentheses were not needed.

2. `let double x = x * 2`

The error was that `b` was used in place of `x`.

3. 

```hs
x = 7
y = 10
f = x + y
```

The error was that `y` was not on the same declaration column.
